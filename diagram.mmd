Overview:
This codebase appears to be a simple application that manages different screens or views related to a car's performance and a weekly schedule, with no apparent core functionality beyond these views.

Components:
* CreditCard: Manages credit card information and basic operations such as company data retrieval and validation.
* Car: Controls the behavior of a vehicle by simulating honking, accelerating, and displaying speed information.
* HomeScreen: Displays a welcome message to the user, but does not perform any actions beyond this.
* MainScreen: Serves as an entry point for the application, but currently does nothing.
* Monday: Represents a day of the week, but does not contain any meaningful behavior or data.
* Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday: Similarly represent days of the week and do not provide any functionality.
* TimeTableApp: Builds and possibly configures the application, depending on other components.

Architecture Pattern:
The codebase follows an Object-Component Architecture pattern, which separates concerns into distinct objects that communicate with each other through methods.
